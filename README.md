## 🌟 About Me

I’m a data enthusiast who thrives on solving puzzles—ever since I was a kid, untangling jigsaw pieces and brain teasers has driven me toward data-driven problem solving. As a **hardworking and persistent learner**, I’m happiest when I’m:

- **Digging into new datasets** to uncover hidden patterns and actionable insights  
- **Designing predictive models** that forecast future risks or opportunities  
- **Collaborating with teammates**—because shared “aha!” moments are the best

When I’m not immersed in data, you’ll find me:

- 💃 **Dancing**: There’s a rhythm to data the way there’s a rhythm to dance—patterns, timing, and flow. Just like choreography, I love choreographing data pipelines that move seamlessly from raw inputs to final insights.  
- 👩‍🍳 **Cooking & Experimenting**: Combining ingredients in new ways reminds me of feature engineering—tweaking a recipe until it’s just right. Whether it’s a spicy curry or a healthy smoothie bowl, I’m always testing new “data points” in my kitchen lab.  
- 🤝 **Connecting & Collaborating**: From leading study groups in college to organizing community hackathons, I believe learning happens best together. I’ve chaired multiple workshops and hack days, always eager to share tips (and dance moves!) with friends and peers.

## 🚀 What Drives Me in Data

- **Puzzle Mindset**: Each dataset is a puzzle waiting to be solved.  
- **Curiosity & Persistence**: No question is too small; no query too complex. I keep iterating until every edge case is addressed.  
- **Impact-Oriented**: I love turning insights into action—whether it’s improving program engagement in nonprofits or optimizing forecasts for healthcare. Data is only as good as the decisions it informs.

## 🎯 My Philosophy

> “Data, like dance, is about finding harmony in patterns.”  
>
> - Every dataset has a beat—a cadence that emerges when you let the numbers lead. I aim to uncover those rhythms, choreograph insights, and empower teams to move in sync toward data-driven success.

## 🎉 Fun Facts & Passions

- **Dance & Data:** Just as a choreographer designs steps to music, I design data pipelines to tell a story. Both require anticipation, precision, and creativity.  
- **Culinary Scientist:** Experimenting with spices is my version of hyperparameter tuning—adjusting little elements until the result is deliciously balanced.  
- **Community Builder:** I’ve led 5+ college hackathons and data-science study groups—nothing beats the energy of a room full of problem-solvers collaborating in real time.
