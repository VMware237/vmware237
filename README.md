## 🌟 About Me

I’m a data enthusiast who thrives on solving puzzles—ever since I was a kid, untangling jigsaw pieces and brain teasers has driven me toward data-driven problem solving. 

---

## 🚀 What Drives Me in Data

- **Puzzle Mindset**: Each dataset is a puzzle waiting to to uncover hidden patterns and actionable insights.  
- **Curiosity & Persistence**: No question is too small; no query too complex. I keep iterating until every edge case is addressed.  
- **Impact-Oriented**: I love turning insights into action—whether it’s improving program engagement in nonprofits or optimizing forecasts for healthcare. Data is only as good as the decisions it informs.

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

- **Languages & Libraries**:  
  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) · SQL · R  
- **BI & Visualization**:  
  Tableau · Power BI · Looker · Advanced Excel (Pivot Tables, VBA)  
- **Cloud & Data Engineering**:  
  AWS (Glue, Lambda, S3, Redshift, SageMaker) · Azure Synapse · Snowflake · Streamlit  
- **ML & Statistical Methods**:

## 🎉 Fun Facts & Passions

When I’m not immersed in data, you’ll find me:

- 💃 **Dancing**: I see data like choreography—patterns, timing, and flow—and love designing pipelines that move seamlessly from raw input to insight.
- 👩‍🍳 **Cooking & Experimenting**: Mixing ingredients mirrors feature engineering—tweaking until everything comes together perfectly.
- 🤝 **Connecting & Collaborating**: Collaborating with teammates because shared “aha!” moments are the best.
