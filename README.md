Hi there, I'm Vaishnavi Arvind Mhaske! ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)
=================================================================================================================================================

As a recent graduate with a Master's in Computer Science and an Honors degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I am eager to embark on a professional journey. My academic background has equipped me with a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. I am particularly fascinated by the power of data to tell compelling stories and drive business decisions. <br>

During my internship at IBM Pheme Software Ltd., I honed my skills in transforming raw data into actionable insights. Proficient in Python, SQL, R, and Tableau, I have a proven ability to analyze data and visualize trends, aiding in informed decision-making. My projects, including Customer Sales Analysis and Azure Data Engineering, demonstrate my capability to deliver clear and impactful data solutions. <br>

In my free time, I enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles and participating in escape rooms. These hobbies have sharpened my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, which I find invaluable in my data analysis work. Just like piecing together a puzzle or finding a way out of an escape room, I thrive on identifying patterns and solving complex problems through data.
